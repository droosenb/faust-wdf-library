## Complex Wave-Digital Models in Faust

This section currently contains in-development models for the wave-digital library. After they are completed, they may either be removed or placed in "Examples."

Code here is untested and often not fully working. Do not expect support for these files. Specific models may be added or removed without warning or notice.  

### R-types

A major focus of these models is support of R-type nodes in Faust. Typically, induvial R-nodes must be derived using modified nodal analysis. I have developed code which uses Julia and Mathematica to perform this task in a somewhat automated way. I have included my in-development code which performs this though I offer no guarantees as to accuracy or ease of use. I hope to support this code in a more meaningful way in the future.
